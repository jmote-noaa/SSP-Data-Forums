# SSP Data Forums

More intro language needed.

A key part of the Data Forums is the use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org), a web application for producing computational narratives  Jupyter Notebooks are browser applications which run code and renders text, mathematical notation, images and videos. Jupyter notebook is a powerful open source tool for scientific computing, reproducible research and teaching data science.

Come join other instructors, researchers and students at UBC to share their Jupyter experiences and to learn about new Jupyter tools!
